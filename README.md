# Iris
 This project aims to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their morphological features using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The well-known Iris dataset, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three Iris species, is used to train and evaluate the model.
