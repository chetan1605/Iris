# Iris Species Prediction Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their morphological features using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The well-known Iris dataset, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three Iris species, is used to train and evaluate the model.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers: 
- Iris setosa
- Iris versicolor
- Iris virginica

Each sample has four features:
1. Sepal length (cm)
2. Sepal width (cm)
3. Petal length (cm)
4. Petal width (cm)

## Model

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is used for classification. This algorithm classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified. It is simple, effective, and commonly used for pattern recognition.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed. To install the required dependencies, use the following command:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. *Data Preprocessing*: Load the dataset, handle any missing values, and split it into training and test sets.
2. *Model Training*: Train the KNN model on the training set.
3. *Model Evaluation*: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test set.

### Steps to Run

1. *Preprocess the Data*: Clean and split the dataset.
2. *Train the Model*: Initialize and train the KNN model with chosen hyperparameters.
3. *Evaluate the Model*: Assess the model performance on the test data.

## Results

The KNN model typically achieves high accuracy in predicting Iris species, with common metrics such as:

- *Accuracy*: ~97%
- *Precision*: ~97%
- *Recall*: ~97%
- *F1-Score*: ~97%

## Future Work

Potential enhancements for this project include:
- *Hyperparameter Tuning*: Optimize KNN parameters using techniques like grid search.
- *Feature Engineering*: Explore and add new features to improve model performance.
- *Algorithm Comparison*: Compare KNN with other machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
